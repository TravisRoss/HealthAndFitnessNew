# HealthAndFitnessNew
Health and Fitness app created for my final year project at University using Java.

An application created using a Firebase database to store user information, complete with step tracking and pre-made workouts along with the option to create and edit user information. Steps are recorded in Firebase in real time and user goals are updated in realtime.
